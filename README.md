# Password-Checker-Project
This is a short project I created for a password checker to check the strength of your password out of a score of 5. It was my first time using python to create a working project

## Features

- Returns a score from 0-5

## Built With 
Python 3.13.12

## How to Run
1. Clone the Repository
2. Navigate to the folder
3. Run the Programme : Password Checker.py

## Example Output
